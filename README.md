# Python Basics

This repository contains Python examples worked through interactively with cadets from 1082 (Brimington & District) Squadron, Air Training Corps (ATC).

These have been created during the UK lock down. They are relevant to any beginner to Python, and especially
those studying for a UK GCSE in Computer Science.

The topics folder contains code that was typed in interactively during discussion over Microsoft Teams during the lockdown.

The programmes folder contain sample programmes that take this knowledge and apply it to a particular problem domain.

Over time this will build up from simple to more sophisticated example programmes. All of them though
will impart knowledge useful for UK GCSE and A Level Computer Science courses.

## Getting set up

The easiest way to get set up using free software for Python is the follow the first few steps in Microsoft VS Code's tutorial guide below:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial

This will give you all the software you need in a fully working system. It's free and open source software.

## Further information

There's a great cheatsheet reference to Python here:

## Why are Air Cadets learning to write code?

Part of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets (RAFAC) commitment to Science, Technology, Engineering & Maths (STEM) subjects is around online safety and computer skills. Computer Science and programming are both skills useful in the armed forces and civilian life. They teach critical thinking, problem solving, planning, and team work skills in addition to their core engineering skills. This is therefore a valuable activity for cadets to do in addition to other core cadet forces activities.

## Can I contribute?

Whilst most of our repositories are open to Pull Requests, this one tracks our internal training and development, and as such we'll only add to it once we've taught specific sections.
